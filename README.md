# my-scribble-space
A simple web project that provides the space to your friends to express what they feel about you. I created this during the lockdown period as an alternative to the scribble day of our final semester, you can use it as you feel like.

Technologies used:- HTML, CSS, BOOTSTAP, jQuery, Ajax, Php and MySQL.

You can check out the website at :- http://myscribblespace.epizy.com/ ( Currentlt the webiste is hosted at a free server because of which at times it might miss connecting with the database)
